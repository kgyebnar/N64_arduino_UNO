# n64-arduino
Plug two N64 controllers to an Arduino and turn your Arduino in a USB HID joystick! Play your favourite games on the pc with the best controller ever!

I've had some trouble setting up MickMad's original project, so I decided to fix it. Somehow my Arduino swapped the buttons with the joystick, so I had to [fix the order](https://github.com/twinone/n64-arduino/commit/7aa0165292885c81427e76dc71b11373e79d2d90).
I use [mupen64plus](http://www.mupen64plus.org/) ([github](https://github.com/mupen64plus)), so I generated the config file so that both controllers work with it directly.

# Instructions

We will use Linux or OSX to program the Arduino's main processor and also the atmega16u2 (the programmer). The atmega16u2 chip allows us to use the Arduino as a USB HID device.

### 0. Download this project to somewhere you like

`git clone github.com/twinone/n64-arduino n64-arduino`

### 1. Install dfu-programmer

osx:

`brew install dfu-programmer`

aptitude:

`apt-get install dfu-programmer`

### 2. Upload the sketch
* Make sure you use an Arduino Uno R3 (or other board with an atmega16u2 for the programmer).
* Open the [sketch](https://github.com/twinone/n64-arduino/blob/master/N64-To-USB/N64_To_USB/N64_To_USB.ino) in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and upload it to your Arduino.

### 3. Metaprogramming: Programming the programmer

* Connect your Arduino to your computer via USB.
* Short the two pins marked in this picture together with a jumper wire (don't worry, you won't burn anything):

* Unshort them again.
* Make sure your Arduino isn't listed in the Arduino IDE's serial port list.

I've attached a very simple script that does the flashing, mainly because I was too lazy to write the 3 commands all the time while I was debugging.

* `./flash.sh joystick.hex`

This will render the programmer useless. If you want to upload a new sketch to your Arduino, you'll have to use `./flash.sh uno.hex` again, which contains the programmer's original firmware.

### 4. The wiring

Here's the pinout for your N64 Controller's plug:

* Connect the Controller's `VCC` to the Arduino's `3v3 pin` (3.3v)
* Connect the Controller's `DATA` to the Arduino's `digital pin 2` (pin 3 for the second controller)
* Connect the Controller's `GND` to the Arduino's `GND` pin

### 5. Reconnect, configure, play!

* Reconnect your arduino to your computer
* Copy the config file to where it belongs:
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/mupen64plus/
cp mupen64plus.cnf ~/.config/mupen64plus/
```
(If you already have a config file, just copy the controller parts)

* Play!
